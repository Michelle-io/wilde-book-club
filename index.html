            Oscar Fingal O'Flahertie Wills Wilde (16 October 1854 – 30 November
            1900) was an Irish poet and playwright. After writing in different
            forms throughout the 1880s, he became one of the most popular
            playwrights in London in the early 1890s. He is best remembered for
            his epigrams and plays, his novel The Picture of Dorian Gray, and
            the circumstances of his criminal conviction for gross indecency for
            consensual homosexual acts in "one of the first celebrity
            trials",imprisonment, and early death from meningitis at age 46.
            <br /><br />
            Wilde's parents were Anglo-Irish intellectuals in Dublin. A young
            Wilde learned to speak fluent French and German. At university,
            Wilde read Greats; he demonstrated himself to be an exceptional
            classicist, first at Trinity College Dublin, then at Oxford. He
            became associated with the emerging philosophy of aestheticism, led
            by two of his tutors, Walter Pater and John Ruskin. After
            university, Wilde moved to London into fashionable cultural and
            social circles.
