          <h2>Oscar's Books: A Journey Around the Library of Oscar Wilde</h2>

          <!-- Book information -->
          <p>
            For Wilde, as for many people, reading could be as powerful and
            transformative an experience as falling in love. He devoured books,
            talked books, luxuriated in books and lavished books on his friends-
            they played, too, a vital part in his seductions of young men.
            Oscar's Books tells the story of Wilde's life through his reading,
            from his childhood in Dublin, where he was nurtured on Celtic myth,
            Romantic poetry and Irish folklore; through his undergraduate years
            in which he built his intellect out of books; to prison, where his
            friends supplied him with literature which saved his sanity; to his
            final years in Paris where he consoled himself with old favourites
            such as Flaubert and Balzac.

          <h2>Best-Loved Oscar Wilde (Best-Loved Irish Writers)</h2>
          <!-- Book information -->
          <p>
            Oscar Fingal O'Flahertie Wills Wilde (1854–1900), one of Ireland's
            most beloved writers, was a playwright, poet, novelist and author of
            fairy stories and political essays. A complex man with many sides,
            he was both a revolutionary thinker and a flamboyant dandy and man
            about town. His wit and razor-sharp observation made him the toast
            of society on both sides of the Atlantic before scandal and
            notoriety stripped him of his position and his freedom.

          <h2>The Collected Works of Oscar Wilde (Special Editions)</h2>
          <!-- Book information -->
          <p>
            Oscar Wilde wrote tender fairy stories for children employing all
            his grace, artistry and wit, of which the best-known is The Happy
            Prince. Counterpoints to this were his novel The Picture of Dorian
            Gray, which shocked and outraged many readers of his day, and his
            stories for adults which exhibited his fascination with the
            relations between serene art and decadent life. Wilde took London by
            storm with his plays, particularly his masterpiece The Importance of
            Being Earnest. His essays - in particular De Profundis- and his
            Ballad of Reading Gaol, both written after his release from prison,
            strikingly break the bounds of his usual expressive range. His other
            essays and poems are all included in this comprehensive collection
            of the works of one of the most exciting writers of the late
            nineteenth century.
